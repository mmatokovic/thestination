Arguably the most breathtaking city of the Adriatic Sea, Dubrovnik is the heart and soul of Croatia. Scattered with red-tiled roofs, cobbled passageways, and luxurious villas, it’s easy to lose yourself in the magical atmosphere here. Wander the city at your own pace before embarking on Dubrovnik’s iconic 2km walk of the city walls at sunset. If you’re a budding Game of Thrones fan like us, we’ll hook you up with some savvy guides who helped scout for the on-set locations to show you the iconic sights that made TV like Srd Hiil, Pile Gate, and Blackwater Bay.

## City of Kings

Fly into Dubrovnik, one of the Mediterranean’s most beautiful walled fortresses, and spend the next four nights at the Villa Dubrovnik overlooking the UNESCO site and fictional capital of the Seven Kingdoms; King’s Landing.

After a good night’s rest, you’ll be met by your guide for your private tour of the city dubbed ‘the Pearl of the Adriatic’. One of the most iconic and notorious locations from the series, you’ll be taken to Srd Hiil to soak in the beautiful panoramic views of the old city set against the blue waters and surrounding islands. Next up, you’ll reach giddy heights as you climb the city walls, an uninterrupted flow of ramparts almost 2 km in length. Pass the Pile Gate and relive the stories of how King Robert Baratheon fought his way to power, and how the Targaryen family were exiled from the land. For the last stop on your tour of King’s Landing, you’ll stop to take in the magnificent views of ‘Blackwater Bay’, the site of the bloody battle when Stannis Baratheon tried to take the Iron Throne from King Joffrey. Head back to your hotel and catch the sunset before a king-sized feast of incredible seafood.

## Take to the seas

The following morning you’ll be met by your guide and private skipper outside the hotel for a short boat transfer to Lokrum Island, a mysterious island home to many legends and myths. Here you’ll be given a private tour of the Benedictine Monastery, used by the show as the chilling House of the Undying in the city of Qarth. You’ll then sail onto the small seaside village of Trsteno, home to the 500-year old Asian plane-trees of the Trsteno Arboretum, used as the gardens of King’s Landing palace and the Red Keep – home of the kings of the Seven Kingdoms.

From here, set sail around the Elafiti Islands – a breathtaking archipelago of thirteen islands. These gem-like islands of the Adriatic are filled with unique beauty, covered in woodlands and with white, rocky outcrops that enhance the deep blue of the sea. Learn how to sail like the Greyjoys around the Isles’ many coves, hidden bays, sandy beaches and fishing villages, where you can stop off to sunbathe and swim in the crystal-clear waters. Anchor for lunch at one of the island’s local seafood restaurants before heading back to your hotel where you can spend your last two days soaking in the rays overlooking the sea and indulging your senses at the luxurious spa.

## Winter is coming

From the coast of Croatia, fly north to the icy expanse of Iceland. A land of volcanoes, glaciers and otherworldly landscapes, you can see why Iceland is the perfect setting for the treacherous land North of the Wall. For the next five nights, you’ll travel around the island taking in the powerful views and natural wonders that set the scene for the menacing north of the Seven Kingdoms. Start off at one of our favourite spots on the island; Torfhús Retreat. The following day, you’ll join your private guide to explore the south coast of Iceland and Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. Head to Skaftafell National Park where you’ll trek up the magnificent Vatnajökull glacier, the largest icecap in the world outside the arctic regions, and where Jon Snow walked North of the Wall. Take your time to marvel at the sweeping vistas, dominated by sparkling white glaciers, jagged grey-blue mountains and seemingly endless black sand beaches.

Next up, it’s the bubbling Geysir hot springs and thundering waterfalls of Þingvellir National Park in the Golden Circle. This dramatic volcanic area is one of the locations for the series’ fourth season and is set on top of a vast, geothermal field dotted with multi-coloured mud pools, hissing steam vents, hot and cold springs, and primitive plants. For a final thrill, experience the wild terrain of the South by horseback.

## Going North of the Wall

Today, you’ll literally head over the wall to Lake Mývatn, located in the heart of north-east Iceland about 105 km south of the Arctic Circle. This epic region is the filming location for The Wall itself, where the wildings roam. Your guide will take you on a trek around the surreal lava craters and cave formations, where you can view the sulphur streaked mountains in the distance. After your hike, take a dip in some familiar looking natural baths to soak your muscles and take in the views. From the wilds of the north, you’ll then head back south to explore Dettifoss waterfall before heading back to civilization in the uber-chic city of Reykjavik for a night staying at the boutique bolthole, Sandhotel. Enjoy the steaming powers of the Blue Lagoon and our top picks of the city’s restaurants and after dark haunts before catching your flight home.
