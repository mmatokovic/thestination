Famed for its natural beauty, rich history, and aromatic lavender fields, Hvar is a firm Croatian favourite of ours. First, we’ll lead you on a walking tour of Stari Grad (Old Town) on the northern side of the island – one of the oldest towns in Europe – to discover incredible gothic palaces, charming churches and chapels and of course the best restaurants on the island. Then for a breath of fresh air, we’ll take you to the hilltop villages of Humac and Vrisnik, where the scent of rosemary and lavender will leave you pining for days.
