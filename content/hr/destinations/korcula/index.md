We like to think of Korčula as Dubrovnik’s little twin sister, and with over 2,000 years of history on the island, there’s no time to waste stepping foot upon the sandy shores here. We’ll begin with a private walking tour of Marco Polo’s birthplace and the alleged origin of the Silk Road, before falling back into luxury at Lešic Dimitri Palace. Spend your days in the company of a private skipper as you cruise around secluded bays, visit local wineries and perfect the art of oyster shucking at Ston Oyster Farm.
